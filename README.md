Repository for the ECSU senior research project 

This project will focus on Genetic Algorithms. Specifically, the selection method of genetic algorithms.

A genetic algorithm is an optimization algorithm, which performs optimization through emulating the process of evolution. 
The selection method is the process in which the best solutions in a population are chosen for "reproducing" to create the next generation.

The goal of the project is to test two types of selection methods in a benchmarking experiment, and determine what if any, the differences are between the two.
